List of Project Files
---------------------

Bare.hs
-------
Raw description of pure types (without dependencies on GHC), 
suitable for parsing from raw strings, and functions for 
converting between bare types and real refinements.

Constraint.hs
-------------
Representation of Sub and WF Constraints, and code for 
syntax-directed constraint generation.

GhcInterface.hs
---------------
Extracting CoreBinds from .hs and also for parsing annotations, 
namely: type- and spec- bindings, also generates source annotations
from solutions.

ANFTransform.hs
---------------
Code to perform the ANF-transformation of the source file.

Tidy.hs
-------
Code to tidy up type annotations before output.

FixInterface.hs
---------------
Process interface to fixpoint binary.

Fixpoint.hs
-----------
Types and functions for representing sorts, expressions, 
predicates, substitutions, other manipulations, and conversion
to fixpoint text-format.

Measure.hs
----------
Code for converting a sequence of measure definitions (equations)
into something usable during consgen (a measure specification).

Parse.hs
--------
All parsers: from strings into sorts, expressions, predicates, 
bare-types, measures, etc.

RefType.hs
----------
Refinement Types Mirroring the GHC Type definition

LiquidPrelude.hs
----------------
??? should be removed, kept in include/

Misc.hs
-------
Miscellaneous helper functions.
