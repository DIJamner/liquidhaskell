(1) in refinements --> all function terms in refts are measures? (Yes)

KNOWN BUGS

- tests/todo/fft.hs

- hmatrix
    > http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/hmatrix/0.12.0.1/doc/html/src/Data-Packed-Internal-Matrix.html#Matrix

- xmonad properties

- NDM/catch benchmarks (with refinements)

- cabal integration
    > so you can build against liquid?
    > how does this affect ghc integration? (shouldn't matter, because you
    > can specify --with-ghc

- binsearch crashes because you have chains like:
        
        x1 = 2
        x2 = x1
        x3 = x2
        z  = x3 / 2

  so I guess you need some constprop inside the constraint simplification.

- tests/pos/data-mono0.hs
  partial pattern match desugars into exception syntax with unhandled
  casts. Throws an error in fixpoint. At least throw error in Constraint Gen?
