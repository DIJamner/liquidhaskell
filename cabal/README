How To Compile
--------------

  $ make deps && make

How To Run 
----------
  
1. add this to .bashrc

LIQUIDHS=PATH/TO/LiquidHaskell/cabal/include/
export LIQUIDHS

2. ensure "fixpoint.native" is in the executable search path

3. path/to/liquid foo.hs

How To Run Tests 
----------------

  $ make deps && make && make test

To use threads to speed up the tests

  $ make THREADS=30 test

or your favorite number of threads, depending on cores etc.


How To Include Spec Files 
-------------------------

1. See include/lib.spec for the format of spec files
2. to include a spec file (other than the above) add the line
        
        {-# ANN module "spec path/to/file" #-}

   after the import declarations of file you're analyzing. 
   
As an example, see: tests/pos/meas0a.hs

How to Profile 
--------------

1. Build with profiling on
    
   $ make pdeps && make prof

2. Run with profiling

   $ time liquid range.hs +RTS -hc -p

   $ time liquid range.hs +RTS -hy -p

   Followed by this which shows the stats file 

   $ more liquid.prof

   or by this to see the graph

   $ hp2ps liquid.hp

   $ gv liquid.ps

   etc.

How to Get Backtraces
---------------------

1. Build with profiling on

    $ make pdeps && make prof

2. Run with backtraces

    $ liquid +RTS -xc -RTS foo.hs
